<center><h1><i><u><font size="8">Your Identity </font></u></i></h1></center>

<center><p><font size="5">
You define yourself.Identity is the conception, qualities, beliefs, and expressions that make a person.
Who you are is your Self Identity, the way you look at yourself and your relationship 
to the world. Understanding this, allows you to examine who you are and more importantly create who you want to be. 
This being said you can choose to be whoever or whatever you want.

<dt>1.You should first think about "What makes me, me?"

<dd>What do I like or dislike?
What's my skills or attributes?
Self Identity is composed of relatively permanent self-assessments, such as personality attributes, 
knowledge of one's skills and abilities, one's occupation and hobbies, and awareness of one's physical attributes.

<dt>5. If you are still not sure who you are. Don't worry about it!
In my opinion all this identity stuff isn't all that important. You are who you are and you can change over time. You don't have to know exactly who you are
now or who you want to be in the future. You don't need a label. Live in the now and go with what your intuition tells you.

<center><h1><i><font size="5">
Gender identity</font></i></h1></center>

One's innermost concept of self as male, female, a blend of both or neither â€“ how individuals perceive
themselves and what they call themselves. One's gender identity can be the same or different from their sex assigned at birth.
