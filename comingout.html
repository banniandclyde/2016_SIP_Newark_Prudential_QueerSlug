Coming out is a lifelong process. It is also a very brave and big decision. Coming out is the process through which an LGBTQ+ 
person accepts their sexual orientation or gender identity as part of their overall identity. 
It not only refers to the process of self acceptance, but also to the act of sharing your identity with others.
This is a <b> BIG </b> step into starting your new lifestyle or journey with the people. For a lot of LGBTQ+ it's hard to tell the 
people that are important t you.
But this is <b> NOT </b> something you <b> HAVE </b> to do. If you dont feel comfortable and feel safe don't come out at that time.

<h1><i><font size="5">Things to consider before coming out: </font></i></h1>

<!-- List-->
<d1>
<h1><i><font size="4">
<dt>1. Are You ready for what could come?

<dd> What I mean by what to come is the criticism that could come with coming out. 
This is a big step and some people are not as enthusiactic as other when it comes to be
If possible, you should make an effort to tell your family and close friends about your 
sexuality or gender before making it public information on social media.
We have heard of many instances where parents find out that a child is gay because someone 
else sees that they changed their status on Facebook or posted 
a video on YouTube. Often, family members are offended and feel like you don't value your 
relationship with them enough to tell them such important information
about yourself firsthand. We have found that parents (and friends) are more likely to respond 
better when the news comes directly from you rather than from someone else.<br />

<br />

<dt>2.<b>Are you clear about yourself?</b>
<dd>Be clear about your own feelings about being gay. 
If you are still dealing with a lot of guilt or depression, 
seek help in getting over that before coming out to parents 
or other non-gay people. If you are comfortable with your gayness, 
those to whom you come out to will often see that fact and be aided
 in their own renewed acceptance of you.

<br />

<dt>3.<b>Don't label yourself if you don't want to.</b>
<dd>Although you may feel ready to come out, you may not feel you 
fit any particular 'label'. Using terms like lesbian, gay and bisexual
is absolutely fine, but never feel forced to identify as anything. 
Listen to your feelings and go with them! If a label helps you and 
feels right then great. If it doesn't then don't worry!<br />

<br />

<dt>4.<b>Don't feel pressured</b>
<dd>Everyone should come out in their own time. You may feel under 
pressure to tell those close to you that you are lesbian, gay or 
bisexual before you are ready. Don't. Coming out is about you and no 
one else. If you start to think about pleasing others you will lose 
sight of what is really important - your happiness. Focusing on 
yourself and what's important to you will ultimately make those 
you're close to happier as well.

<br />

<br />
<dt>5.<b>Don't think that you'll have to choose between your faith 
and your sexuality. </b>
<dd>Most religions have groups for their lesbian, gay and bisexual 
followers. Go online to find a group near you. Having faith and 
being gay are not mutually exclusive!

<br />

<br />

<dt>6.<b>Forget the stereotypes</b>
<dd>When gay people first started to appear on TV and in the media, 
the stereotypes that were common were those of effeminate camp men 
and butch women. Some people still think that every gay man and 
woman have to fit that stereotype. Others may feel that the 
stereotypes have flipped and gay men should be muscular and have
beards while lesbians should have long blonde hair and wear lots
of make up! The truth is, stereotypes suck and we all know they do.
Being lesbian, gay or bi does not have to define you. If you're 
camp, great. If you're butch, fantastic. If you like going to the
gym, good on you. If you prefer a good film to a good run, amazing.
Growing up (and discovering your sexuality) is all about finding out
who you are, what you like and how you want to be and it's an 
exciting time!

<br />

<br />

<dt>7.<b>Think about the positives</b>
<dd>It is very easy to let the anxieties and fears around coming 
out completely take over the experience. But remember, coming out 
is one of the most amazing things you will ever do. You will finally
 be able to be your whole self and it WILL change your life. Those
 butterflies you feel in your stomach - see them as excitement 
 rather than nerves!

<br />

<br />

<dt>8.<b>Read how other people came out</b>
<dd> RUComingOut has over 300 real life coming out stories as well 
as interviews from celebrities. Most people who come out go through 
the same anxieties and they experience very similar fears. Hearing 
how things turned out for others who were at one time in a similar 
situation to you can really help ease your own anxieties.

<br />

<br />

<dt>9.<b>Tell one person.</b>
<dd>When you are ready to come out (you will know when the time feels right) 
- don't think you have to tell everyone straight away -  it's not a race! 
Choose one person who you trust more than anyone else -a friend, sibling, 
parent/guardian or teacher. As soon as you've opened up to the first person 
things will seem a thousand times easier and clearer for you. It's an age old 
saying but talking really does help. You'll also have someone you can talk to
and ask advice from when coming out to others.

<br />

<br />

<dt>10.<b>Timing and Place</b>
<dd>Timing can be very important in coming out. Be aware of the health, mood,
 priorities and problems of those with whom you would like to share your sexuality.
 The mid-life crisis's of parents, the relationship problems of friends, the business 
 concerns of employers and countless other factors over which you have no control
 can affect another's receptivity to your information.

<br />

<br />

<dt>11.<b>Ensure your safety and well-being</b>
<dd>If, based on their prior remarks or attitudes about the LGBTQ community, 
you feel that your parents are not going to react well, so much so that they won't
tolerate your living in their home as an LGBTQ teenager, then we'd recommend 
waiting to come out until you are independent from your family.  This is 
especially the case if your parents have a history of verbally abusive or physically 
aggressive tendencies. You must always put your personal safety first. 
You can always "test the waters" to gauge how your parents feel about other people in 
the LGBTQ community before you start opening up to them about this.
If you absolutely can't wait to come out, and aren't sure if you will be safe after 
coming out to your parents, you need to make sure you have a back-up plan.
This means looking up local LGBTQ shelters, figuring out how much money you need to save
 in order to live on your own, and reaching out to friends and adults 
you can trust. Make sure you know who you can reach out to in case you need temporary housing or emotional support.

<br />

<br />

<dt>12.<b>Give people time.
</b>
<dd>You may have had years to get to a place where you are 
comfortable with being lesbian, gay or bisexual. Just think though,
those people who you will be telling will have a split second to
give you a reaction. Give them chance to digest the news. It may 
come as a complete surprise. Surprise and shock doesn't mean 
disapproval. They may have questions, so pre-empt what these could 
be and be prepared to support them too. They may need your support 
as much as you need theirs!<br />

<br />

<dt>13.<b>Start living! </b>
<dd>You will be amazed at how free you will feel once you have come 
out. Obviously the experience is different for everyone and at times
it may not go as well as you'd like. Just remember that you are 
doing the right thing, you are allowing yourself to be who were 
always meant to be and this means you can start living YOUR life!
Remember to create that safety net around you though, just in case 
things don't go exactly to plan.<br />
